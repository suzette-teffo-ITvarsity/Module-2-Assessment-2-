<p>
American Swiss first opened its doors in Cape Town in 1896. Now, more than a 100 years later, we are South Africa's leading jeweller, with stores located countrywide.

Throughout our history, American Swiss has been at the cutting edge of jewellery trends, complementing the look of the day with the luxury and brilliance of fine quality diamond jewellery and watches.</p>

                                <h3>JEWELLERY EDUCATION</h3>
  <p>At American Swiss, we create jewellery that is inspired by life and its precious moments, with quality at the heart of everything we do. Every detail of our fine jewellery is carefully considered. The ultimate luxury is knowing how your piece has been created.</p>

                            <h3>PLATINUM</h3>

<p>Platinum is the most precious and valuable of all metals. Its natural white sheen makes it a beautiful setting for precious gemstones and its durability and scratch resistance makes it the perfect metal for jewellery such as wedding bands. At American Swiss we offer a limited range of Platinum pieces; however we do offer a bespoke service for creating something special for yourself.

<h3>GOLD</h3>
<p>Gold is one of the most precious metals and has been valued and revered for thousands of years. Its lustre and bright yellow sheen is instantly recognisable. However in its pure form, Gold is too soft to work with. To make it suitable for jewellery other metals (alloys) are added to pure Gold, making it more durable. This can result in not only a stronger metal but other colour varieties such as white and the ever so trendy rose.</p>

   <h3>STERLING SILVER</h3>
 <p>Sterling silver is a timeless classic and has been a celebrated metal and form of currency since it was first discovered. Similar to Gold, Sterling Silver must have other metals added to ensure it is strong enough for jewellery. While Sterling Silver is best known for its brilliant polished shine, it can also come in a matte finish, allowing for a range of effects and designs.</p>

                                       <h3>JEWELLERY CARE</h3>
<p>By following a few simple tips you can keep your jewellery looking as beautiful as the day you bought it.

Always remove your jewellery when washing your hands or applying perfume and makeup. Never spray perfume on top of jewellery, especially Pearls.
Store your jewellery separately in a lined jewellery box or pouch to avoid scratching.
Rhodium-plated jewellery must be re-plated annually.
For cleaning your jewellery at home, make use of our jewellery cleaners and cloths available for purchase in-store.
For those occasions when your jewellery needs a little more care, speak to one of our experts and remember that American Swiss offers free professional cleaning services for all jewellery.
