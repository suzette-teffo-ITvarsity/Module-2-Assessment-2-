               <h3>HISTORY</h3>
<p>The first GAME store opened in Durban, South Africa, in 1970. It was born out of the belief by its founders that shopping had become a tedious and boring pastime. They wanted to create a fun shopping environment and so conceptualized retailing as a game. The signature shocking pink has still prevailed to this day.
We operate out of 150 stores in 12 African countries.</p>
