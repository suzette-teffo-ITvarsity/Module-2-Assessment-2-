                           <h3>Partnership</h3>
<p>Mutual respect is integral to the culture of the group. We therefore refer to our co-workers as “associates” and, once they own shares or share options, they are referred to as “partners”. Partnership is sharing the ownership and success of the company with all our associates and fostering solid and long-term relationships with our suppliers. Without our customers, we would not have a business, and they are one of our most valued partners. We also partner with communities, by investing in strategic initiatives that will improve the lives of those who are less fortunate, particularly children and youth.</p>
