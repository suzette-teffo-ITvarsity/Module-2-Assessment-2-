               <h3>Our purpose</h3>
 <p>To use our financial expertise to do good for individuals, families, businesses and society.</p>
               <h3>Vision</h3>
<p>To be the most admired financial services provider in Africa by our staff, clients, shareholders, regulators and society.

Our vision statement implies that:
We will continue to build our franchise in South Africa, while expanding into the rest of Africa. Our strategic focus areas provide more insight into our progress and outlook 
We want to be most admired by our stakeholders. Without passionate and motivated staff members we will not be able to attract and retain the clients that are key to the delivery of sustainable profits for our shareholders. As a bank we operate in a regulated environment and we aim to be admired by our regulators. Lastly, as a bank we can play a major part in our communities and, as the green bank, we are a strong advocate and influencer on environmental matters.</p>
