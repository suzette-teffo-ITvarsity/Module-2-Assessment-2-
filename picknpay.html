<p>Brand South Africa was established in August 2002 to help create a positive and compelling brand image for South Africa.
At that time, the world was unsure about what to think of South Africa, with many different messages being sent out by various sources. This did very little to build the countryâ€™s brand and it was evident that to attract tourism and investment there was a need to co-ordinate marketing initiatives to make them more effective.This led to the creation of Brand South Africa, whose main objective is the marketing of South Africa through the Brand South Africa campaign.There are many benefits to having a consolidated brand image, with the most important being that a consistent Brand South Africa message creates strategic advantages in terms of trade and tourism for the country in an increasingly competitive marketplace.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Founded in 1967 as a family controlled business with four small stores in the Western Cape, Pick n Pay listed on the JSE the following year. Raymond Ackerman purchased the small chain of supermarkets from Goldin, and went on to develop Pick n Pay into South Africa's largest supermarket group.</p>
